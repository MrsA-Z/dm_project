%\subsection{About the data} %where will we get it
%\label{sec:background}
The data we will use for this project is provided by yelp in the course of their 7\textsuperscript{th} "yelp dataset challenge" (\url{https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge}). %\cite{www:yelpdataset}
It includes information about businesses in 10 cities over 4 countries. Besides data such as reviews, tips, business attributes, social network of users and aggregated check-ins over time for each business the set includes pictures from the respective businesses. For our purposes we will predominantly use the following data: \\
   - 	566K business attributes, e.g., hours, parking availability, ambience\\
   - 	2.2M reviews and 591K tips by 552K users for 77K businesses\\
The data set is provided for download on the corresponding yelp data challenge page. It contains a file for each single object type, which itself contains one JSON-object per line. %Example?!
