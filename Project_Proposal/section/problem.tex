\section{Our problem}
\label{cha:problem}

Why are certain gastronomy facilities more popular and economically successful than others?\\  
Search and rating websites such as trip advisor, yelp etc. present business profiles including specific properties, such as location, price range, opening hours, cuisine, and user based rating. As a result these properties play a decisive role in the decision process of potential customers looking for a place to drink their coffee or have a nice meal. When only taking those rather general attributes into account, many businesses seem similar while their economical success, however, often differs significantly. As a consequence we wonder which other determining factors make people choose one business over another and in addition help businesses to retain those customers. \\
Some of these attributes can be found when taking a look at textual reviews where people state their opinion on certain extended characteristics of the business and often give a concluding rating (e.g. through stars at a scale of 1 to 5). The goal of this project is to extract new success aspects of businesses from reviews and assign weights to them according to their importance within a customer's decision process.\\
