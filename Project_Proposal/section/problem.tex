\section{Our problem}
\label{cha:problem}

When people want to choose which restaurant, bar, cafe etc to go they usually take a look at specific properties of the business, such as location, price range, opening hours, cuisine and user based rating. As a result these properties play a decisive role in how successful businesses are. There is a vast amount of businesses which are quite similar if you only take those rather general properties into account, but still their economical success often differs significantly. As a consequence there must be other determining factors that make people choose one business over another. \\
Some of these factors can be found when taking a look at textual reviews where people state their opinion on certain aspects of the business and often give a concluding rating (e.g. through stars at a scale of 1 to 5). The goal of this project is to extract new aspects of the business from reviews that can be used to give a more sophisticated and granular view on the restaurant or bar. 

This is Sophias first Commit.
