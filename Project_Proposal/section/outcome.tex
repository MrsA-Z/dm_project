\label{cha:conclusion}
As project outcome we would like to identify additional success factors and business features important to customers. This knowledge could firstly be used by placing additional decisive attributes into the facility's yelp profile. By that a more in depth representation of businesses is obtained, enabling yelp users to make a faster decision.\\ 
Secondly, the gathered insight into business success factors could be interesting for existing and new businesses as well as start-up consultants, as it could serve as a guideline for upgrading their facility in order to attract and retain more customers.\\ 
Based on our anticipated findings, further analysis could be performed in order to gain a sophisticated overview regarding the current market situation in general. As a result existing and potential future market trends as well as market niches could be identified.\\
