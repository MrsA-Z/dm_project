\section{Possible Results}
\label{cha:conclusion}
As project outcome we would like to identify additional success factors and attractive business features important to customers. This knowledge could firstly be used by placing additional attributes important to customers into the facility's yelp profile. By that a more in depth representation of businesses (restaurants, bars, cafes etc.) is obtained, enabling yelp users to make a faster decision based on further determining attributes.\\ 
Secondly, the gathered insight into business success factors could be interesting for existing and new businesses as well as start-up consultants or even venture capitalists, as it could serve as a guideline when wanting to upgrade their facility in order to attract and retain more customers.\\ 
Based on our anticipated findings, further analysis could be performed in order to gain a sophisticated overview regarding the current market situation in general. As a result existing and potential future market trends as well as market niches could be identified.\\
